# Greek Language Tools

Greek Language Tools is a set of tools that will help you make easy transformations to Greek words.

## Installation

`pip install greek-language-tools`

## Usage

Import as any other module using the name `greeklt`

`from greeklt import *` 

- **capitalize(word)**

Makes a word all caps without accentuation but adds dieresis when necessary:

```
word = "γάιδαρος"
>>> word.upper()
ΓΆΙΔΑΡΟΣ

>>> capitalize(word)
ΓΑΪΔΑΡΟΣ
```

- **remove_accentuation(word)**

Removes accentuation but adds dieresis when necessary, without capitalizing:

```
word = "γάιδαρος"

>>> remove_accentuation(word)
γαϊδαρος
```

Works exceptionally well when you want to sort a list aphabetically and not based on unicode:

```
cities = ["Όσλο", "Λευκωσία", "Άκαμπα", "Ζυρίχη", "Ρώμη"]

>>> sorted(cities)
["Άκαμπα", "Όσλο", "Ζυρίχη", "Λευκωσία", "Ρώμη"]

>>> sorted(cities, key=remove_accentuation)
["Άκαμπα", "Ζυρίχη", "Λευκωσία", "Όσλο", "Ρώμη"]
```

- **convert_final_s(word)**

Checks last letter of each word in a string. If it is a `σ` it is converted into a `ς` (final `σ`):

```
>>> convert_final_s("Φάροσ φάρος ΦΑΡΟΣ")
Φάρος φάρος ΦΑΡΟΣ
```

- **greek_transliteration(word)**

Transliterates a string written with latin characters into it's equivalent Greek (based on the keys of a QWERTY keyboard):

```
>>> greek_transliteration("fvtia")
φωτια
```

This can come quite in handy when a user forgets to change the language and the word looks the same both in latin and Greek:
```
# ANNA written in latin (Anna)
name = "ANNA"

>>> name == greek_transliteration(name)
False

# Both look the same but are different unnicode characters
>>> ANNA == ΑΝΝΑ
False
```

There's also the abillity to convert a word from latin to it's intended accentuated once in Greek:

```
>>> greek_transliteration("P;ita soybl;aki")
Πίτα σουβλάκι

>>> greek_transliteration("kaWiki")
καΐκι

>>> greek_transliteration("pro:yp;ouesh")
προϋπόθεση

>>> greek_transliteration("GA:IDAROS")
ΓΑΪΔΑΡΟΣ
```

Note: The function takes as given that the user intended to write the work in Greek using the correct key sequence but just didn't switch their keyboard to Greek. It doesn't convert from Greeklish!

```
# Wrong key sequence by user.
# They're supposed to press SHIFT + W and not just w for the ΅ character to appear.
>>> greek_transliteration("kawiki")
καςικι
```
